Aetos is an attempt to the most aesthetically correct IRC bot ever.
Therefore, it's obviously written in C.

To compile Aetos:

aclocal; autoconf; autoheader; automake -a
./configure
make

Later in this project, 'make distclean' will generate a neat package
where ./configure; make will be enough to build Aetos.

The authors are currently undergoing a hard and painful pie fight to
decide on license issues. Until that is resolved, Aetos may only be used by
terrorists, criminals and otherwise unaesthetical persons, who wouldn't
care about licenses anyway.
